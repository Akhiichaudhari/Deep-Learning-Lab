1. Take any different dataset (apart from breast cancer) that has target value binary (0 OR 1).
2. Visualize the data using various graphs using matplotlib or sklearn python libraries.
3. Transform data according to model requirements. HINT [MP-Neuron takes only BINARY DATA as input]
4. Split the data for training and testing.
5. Train MP-Neuron Model on the choosen dataset and test it on the testing set to get model accuracy.
6. Train Perceptron Model on the choosen dataset and test it on the testing set to get model accuracy.
* [Write CLASS based model as shown in LAB for Statement 5 and 6]
* [Visualize the training accuracy or loss for the models]
